# Marine Ship Implementation using Closet Pair

## Introduction

The Project offer two main services which are closest pair finder and collision avoider system. The Closest Pair finder is based upon the implementation of closest pair problem and collision avoider is an algorithm devised by our tech team which avoid collison between marine ship thus avoiding any loss.


## Services

1. Closest Pair Finder 
2. Collision Avoider System which can be implemented in cars and ship deployed with sensors.
3. Responsive Design to wor on all types of devices

## Tech Stacks Used
